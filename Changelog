Changelog

v2.0.2 - TDB
- Introduced 'struct sockaddr_in' and modified Pcap.GetPcapAddress() to use sockaddr_in for IPv4 addresses. 
Previously the code was incorrectly attempting to extract the address from the sockaddr directly. Fixes a user 
reported bug where IPv4 addresses are displayed incorrectly from PcapDevice.ToString().
- Modifed 'struct pcap_pkthdr' to contain a proper 'struct timeval'. Fixes a bug where 64 bit platforms 
would see crashes when reading packets from a PcapOfflineDevice. Crash was due to a segfault because the 
pcap_pkthdr size differed from that of the platform and the packet size was coming back as some large and 
invalid value. The subsequent marshalling of the packet data would be out of the range of data and would 
produce the segfault.
- Fixed a few of the examples in the html documentation.

v2.0.1 - 20090207
- Upgraded the example projects to VS2008 format
- Added the example projects to the main solution so the examples are built along with the SharpPcap 
assembly and the unit tests
- Fixed compile errors in the examples due to the large number of changes in the library
- Removed the no longer needed Examples/SharpPcap.sln and the old assembly dll file
- Added some svn:ignore entries to Example directories to keep the svn status output clean
- Removed the IPAddressList class. Much of this functionality is unused.
- Removed some unused methods of the Convert class
- Removed unused PcapDevice.m_ip member variable and accessor
- Removed unnecessary Packets/SupportClass.cs
- Moved TypesOfService_Fields into IPv4Packet as this field is IPv4 specific. Removed 
Packets/TypesOfService.cs
- Renamed 'public struct EthernetProtocols_Fields' to 'public struct EtherType' and moved the struct inside 
of class EthernetPacket for better encapsulation. Removed EthernetProtocols.cs and EthernetProtocol.cs.
- Move 'public struct IPVersions_Fields' into IPPacket.cs and rename to 'public enum IPVersions'. Remove now 
empty IPVersions.cs

v2.0.0 - 20090205
- Renamed the Tamir.IPLib namespace to SharpPcap to match the name of the assembly
- Added Mono support
- Standardize on using System.Net.IPAddress to represent IP addresses instead of a mix of strings and long 
values
- Upgraded project files to VS2008 format
- Use System.Collections.Generic List<> instead of type-specific classes. Remove the type specific classes.
- Added test for parsing of Ethernet packets
- Removed SharpPcap.Packets.IPAddress class
- Implemented IPv6 support in IPPacket with the help of a patch from David Bond.
- Fixed access of freed memory by fully processing pcap devices
- Removed several unused classes, files and tests
